Running over the nightmares of the night
A new evil force is into me
Destroy is what you teach me
And kill is what I'm gonna do, Master!
I will help him to die
I will show the pain I'm suffering
Giving death with the pain
Just one winner for Infernus

Fake angels are what I see
Real love is what I need
That's why I'm gonna kill
I've no mercy as they hadn't for me

With no feeling I can't be sinner
That's what they gave me so far
It's not me, it's not you
It's just the way it is
It's not me, it's not my fault
It's just the way it is
Fake angels are what I see
Real love is what I need
That's why I'm gonna kill
I've no mercy as they hadn't for me
